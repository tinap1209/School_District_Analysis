##Overview of the school district analysis:

We were asked to help Maria, a district data analysis, who is inchare of satandrerdised testing, help analyse data on student funding and students's standerdised test scores. Will were given axis to every students math and reading scores and other information on the schools the students attend. 

##The purpose of this analysis is well defined:

Our analysis, will help school boards make decisions about budgets and allotments. Stict privacy must be maintained under FERPA.

##There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data

How is the district summary affected?

Out of 15 schools
total students: 39170
total budget was:$24,649,428.00	
Average math score was 70.0
Average reading score was 81.9
and overall pass percentage was 65.172326

How is the school summary affected?

Out of the 15 schools, top 5 schools were taken into consideration and the number of students playes a very important role. 

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

Math and reading scores by grade: There was no difference as there were less than 5 students who took math in 9th grade. 

Scores by school spending: No difference

Scores by school size: No difference

Scores by school type: No difference. 

##Summary

The schools were not a lot of changes that I notices after changing the scores of NaNs.
